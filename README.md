# MinTIC "Mediciones" Scrapper

To run the scrapper, first clone the repo.

As a side step, if you feel like it, you can create a virtual environment via `python -m venv .Venv`.
Also, you would need to activate the venv via `.Venv/Scripts/activate.bat`.

Then, install the dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

And lastly you should be good to go! Run the scrapper via `python src/app.py`.
